#+TITLE: Another Hacker News Client


* Introduction

Lincoln de Sousa has
[[https://github.com/clarete/hackernews.el][clarete/hackernews.el]].
It supports list stories, open link in internal/external browser, mark
as read. However, that is hardly any improvement from reading
hackernews on web.

This client is designed to offer a premium reading experience.

* Install and Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package hn
  :straight (hn :type git :host github
                :repo "lihebi/hn.el"))
#+END_SRC

Run command =hn-master= to bring the buffer. Shortcuts:

- =m= :: load more
- =l= :: list only unread articles
- =L= :: list all articles
- =g= :: refresh
- =G= :: hard refresh. By default, the top stories list and items
         (stories and comments) are cached to avoid network
         traffic. Hard refresh will empty the cache, so that you will
         see new posts and new comments.
- =c= :: read comment in comment viewer

- Push button semantic :: the title, comment and user fields are
     buttons. Click the buttons will open external browser for the
     article, the hackernews comment page, and the user profile page.

- ENTER key :: There is also a special semantic for ENTER key.  ENTER
               on the buttons will trigger push-button event. ENTER on
               other space will open comment viewer for current
               article.

* Detailed Feature List (TODOs)

** TODO Subscribe for update for easy tracking
When I read a topic on HN, I will only read the threads at that
time. I'll probably not going to read any updates to the thread
afterwards unless it is a reply to my comment (and I seldom post
comments, thus very rarely to read the thread again). There needs a
solution for that: I should be able to subscribe to the thread and
receive the new contents and consume them easily.

- Subscribe to a topic
- list subscribed topics, and the meta data (score and comment count)
- update (new comment) to subscribed topic should show up in a status
  control panel
- each comment status (new or read) is shown explicitly in the comment
  tree-view
- mark comment as read/unread

** TODO easy for scanning
- selected keyword highlights
- comments & points highlights
- selected source highlights

** TODO Notes
We should be able to take variety of notes, including:
- Star/Label a comment/topic. Can give different labels.
- Write notes. Can be used to compose a reply. Probably not support
  login and post reply directly. Do it on web interface is easier and
  good enough.

** TODO Following users
Follow a user. You can set your user ID and the user IDs you care
about, with different tags. Then, you can
- browse all history thread they post, comment
- receive (see) their recent post in a higher priority whenever they
  post a thread or comment
- when reading the list or comments, have their ones highlighted

** TODO Reproducible
Finally, all these reading data are cleanly stored in lists and can be
version controlled to reproduce the exact reading status at any of
your machine, at any given time.
